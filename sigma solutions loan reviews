Some lenders offer loans without a credit check, but the fees associated with these types of loans are quite high. These may not be your only option, though.

If you request a loan without a credit check, you’re telling the lender you have very bad credit. That raises a red flag for any lender, whose goal is to minimize risks when extending loans.

Even if it’s not a credit check, any lender will want some hard proof that you’re able to repay a loan you receive. Most payday loan brokers, such as CashAdvance.com, will review your bank statements to look for regular direct deposits to qualify you for a loan.

But a cash advance short-term loan will require repayment in two weeks to 30 days. Add on a three-digit interest rate, and you can find yourself paying dearly for a small loan.
