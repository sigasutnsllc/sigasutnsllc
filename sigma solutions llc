Prepare your formal application: Once you’ve chosen a loan offer, the lending network will transfer you to the lender’s website. This is the last you’ll deal with the network, as it is not a lender and operates on referral fees from partner lenders.

The lender’s website is where you’ll complete the application. Remember, you’ve prequalified for the loan, but that doesn’t guarantee approval.

The lender has viewed your soft credit check, which includes a limited amount of information. But as long as the hard credit check doesn’t reveal anything out of the ordinary, you should be good to go.

Make sure you’re thorough in your application. When listing your income, lenders often allow you to include Social Security checks or other retirement or government benefits you receive. Child support payments typically qualify as income as well.

Also, be certain to submit accurate personal information. Even a small typo in your address, name, Social Security number, or another field could create delays in processing your application and jeopardize approval.
